# GEOG 575: Interactive Cartography
# Madison Sherwood-Walter
# Leaflet Lab
# This is an interactive map using United Nations Data to show the top carbon emittors from each year the UN has published data.
# Many countries have had a continuous trend of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere as time moves forward, 
# but a number of countries that were top ten emittors in 1975 and 1985 have gradually reduced their emissions over time.
